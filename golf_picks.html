<h2>Criteria For selection</h2>

<ul>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Enjoyment</li>
<li>Ease of Access</li>
<li>Difficulty</li>
</ul>



<p>
    What I have based this list on is a mixture of cost, course enjoyment, ease of access(ie. how hard it is to get a tee time), 
    and difficulty of course. A course that is easy to get on and costs less to play can be more enjoyable than a harder course,
    but it can also be less enjoyable dependant on the challenge you're looking to face. In my own personal experience, I like to
    be challenged competitively while also enjoying my time playing.

        While the course features water and out of bounds on most holes, it is a bombers paradise. You can hit driver all over
        the map out here and post a good round as long as you stay in bounds. In my personal oppinion of this being my home 
        course, I have ranked it slightly lower on enjoyment just based on having played it so much it loses its luster, 
        but is great for the price, and ability to get on relatively easy most days.

        For those who have never been to <a href="https://www.loganutah.gov/government/departments/parks_and_recreation/logan_river_golf_course/">Logan River</a> there is one thing that is extremely prominent there, and that is water.
        Anyone looking to play who is not in great command og their golf ball may want to keep a few extra in the bag in case
        one or two take a splash. It provides a good test if you are looking to tactically play a course, but best keep that
        driver in the bag for the day.

        The last course on this list is <a href="https://eaglemountaingc.com/">Eagle Mountain</a>. If you have never played it, my best advice is hit it straight, and 
        avoid walking the course if you dont want to get a major leg workout in. The front nine is situated on the mountain
        side, and is tiered from hole to hole up to the highway going through Brigham City. More often than not the rough is
        long, and an errant tee shot will find itself a fairway over and about 25-30 feet lower or higher than the hole you are 
        trying to play. While difficult, it is a good test to see how your game shapes up.
